00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,726
Good morning. Today we would like to introduce our Stem product to you within

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:06,894
goal free. We've chosen Goal 3.9.

3
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:10,410
We want to prevent people from dying from accidental

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,594
carbon monoxide poisoning. But why can't

5
00:00:13,642 --> 00:00:17,898
people stay away from these gases? Because these chemicals are odorless

6
00:00:17,994 --> 00:00:21,934
and is hard to identify with only smell. And most people

7
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:26,178
can't afford a well developed system to detect gases in households.

8
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:29,474
We would like to develop a system that keep on monitoring the presence

9
00:00:29,522 --> 00:00:33,346
of a certain gases and give warning to people. If a certain gas

10
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:36,726
is detected, the device will send warnings to people around it

11
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:40,378
and the users can check the exact concentration of the gas in the

12
00:00:40,384 --> 00:00:43,962
air through a system. This is our prototype using an

13
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:48,170
Arduino board. On the front there is a two four

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,766
a LCD screen. It can be used to show

15
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:55,610
the data of the sensors and help the user to check if it is allowed

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,386
to communicate using different methods. We will introduce

17
00:00:59,418 --> 00:01:03,054
this later. By looking at the site we can

18
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:06,974
see that there's the Adjournal uno board as the processing

19
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:10,270
center of the system and Evernet Shield

20
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,822
for Adrenal uno to get access to the Internet.

21
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:17,922
And by looking at the back you can see the two sensors

22
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:20,550
and the potential meter for testing.

23
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,994
There are three outputs for the system using Arduino

24
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:29,362
board. Firstly, it can show the data directly on the LCD

25
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:33,094
display as shown. Secondly, it can transfer the

26
00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:36,226
data to the app on your smartphone using Bluetooth,

27
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:40,010
but the process is a bit slow as an alternative.

28
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,174
The alternative can also send the data to an IP address as

29
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:47,582
a web page. If you want to know more about how the system works,

30
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:51,722
you may refer to this document. If you want to understand how the gas

31
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:55,514
sensors detect the gases, you may visit this website for the details.

32
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:56,494
Thank you.
