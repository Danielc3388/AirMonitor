00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,726
Good morning. Today we would like to introduce our Stem product to you within

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:06,894
goal free. We've chosen Goal 3.9.

3
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:10,986
We want to prevent people from dying from accidental carbon

4
00:00:11,018 --> 00:00:14,606
monoxide poisoning. But why can't people stay away from

5
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:18,254
these gases? Because these chemicals are odorless and

6
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:21,934
is hard to identify with only smell. And most people

7
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:26,178
can't afford a well developed system to detect gases in households.

8
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:29,474
We would like to develop a system that keep on monitoring the presence

9
00:00:29,522 --> 00:00:33,526
of a certain gases and give warning to people. If a certain gas is

10
00:00:33,548 --> 00:00:37,346
detected, the device will send warnings to people around it and the users

11
00:00:37,378 --> 00:00:40,842
can check the exact concentration of the gas in the air through

12
00:00:40,896 --> 00:00:44,566
a system. This is our prototype using an Arduino

13
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:48,170
board. On the front there is a two four

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,546
a LCD screen. It can be used to

15
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:54,846
show the data of the sensors and help the user to check if it

16
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:58,122
is allowed to communicate using different methods.

17
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,886
We will introduce this later. By looking at

18
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:05,858
the site we can see that there's the Adjournal uno board

19
00:01:05,944 --> 00:01:09,122
as the processing center of the system and

20
00:01:09,176 --> 00:01:13,822
Evernet Shield for Adrenal uno to get access to the Internet.

21
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:17,922
And by looking at the back you can see the two sensors

22
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:20,550
and the potential meter for testing.

23
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,590
There are three outputs for the system using Arduino board.

24
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,954
Firstly, it can show the data directly on the LCD display

25
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:33,686
as shown. Secondly, it can transfer the data to

26
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:37,158
the app on your smartphone using Bluetooth, but the process

27
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:40,010
is a bit slow as an alternative.

28
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,742
The alternative can also send the data to an IP address

29
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:47,582
as a web page. If you want to know more about how the system works,

30
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:51,246
you may refer to this document. If you want to understand how

31
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:55,086
the gas sensors detect the gases, you may visit this website for the

32
00:01:55,108 --> 00:01:56,494
details. Thank you.
